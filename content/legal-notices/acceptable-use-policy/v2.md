### Changes to the acceptable use policy

We may revise this acceptable use policy at any time by amending this page. Where appropriate (for example, where the changes limit your rights or increase your obligations), we will also give you notice of the changes by sending you an email – where possible, a reasonable time in advance. If you are using the Services as an anonymous user (and therefore on a session by session basis), the version of this policy which is in force at the beginning of a particular session will apply to your use of the Services during that particular session. We will not notify you of changes.

Please check this page from time to time and give careful consideration to any emails we send you, as the changes to the policy will be binding on you.
