5.2.3	Customer states that:

(a)	all data sourced by Customer for use in connection with the Product or Professional Services shall comply in all respects, including in terms of its collection, storage and processing (which shall include Customer providing all of the required fair processing information to, and obtaining all necessary consents from, Data Subjects), with EU/UK Data Protection Law; and

### 6. SECURITY MEASURES

6.1	Each party agrees to take appropriate, and industry standard, technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful access or processing of Personal Data in connection with this Data Processing Addendum and the Agreement or its accidental loss, destruction or damage.

7.2.1	notify the Customer of the Personal Data Breach without undue delay (but in no event later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the Personal Data Breach); and

7.2.2	provide the Customer without undue delay (wherever possible, no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the Personal Data Breach) with such details as the Customer reasonably requires regarding:

(a)	the nature of the Personal Data Breach (including, the categories and approximate numbers of data subjects and Personal Data records concerned);

(b)	any investigations into such Personal Data Breach;

7.2.3	the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach; and

7.2.4	any measures taken, or that Roadie recommends, to address the Personal Data Breach, including to mitigate its possible adverse effects,

provided that, (without prejudice to the above obligations) if Roadie cannot provide all these details within the timeframes set out in this section 7.2, it shall (before the end of such timeframes) provide the Customer with reasons for the delay and when it expects to be able to provide the relevant details (which may be phased), and give the Customer regular updates on these matters.

### 8. AUDITS

Roadie will make available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the data processing obligations laid down in this DPA including by allowing for and contributing to reasonable audits to determine Roadie’s compliance with its obligations under this DPA. These audits (of frequency of no more than once per year, except where there is reason to suspect a breach of the obligations may have occurred) may be conducted by Customer, auditors mandated by Customer, or public authorities in competent jurisdictions, subject to Customer and Customer’s auditors (if relevant) undertaking reasonable and appropriate confidentiality obligations.   

### 9. CONFIDENTIALITY

Roadie shall, and shall procure that its subprocessors shall, ensure that any persons to whom Roadie discloses Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Personal Data.

### 10. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS.

Subprocessors appointed by Roadie:

10.1	The Product and Professional Services may include an element of hosting. As such, Roadie uses third party providers to provide certain services, including hosting. A list of these third party providers is available at [https://roadie.io/legal-notices/sub-processors/](/legal-notices/sub-processors/) (“Subprocessor Details”).

10.2	These subprocessors will have access to certain data, including relevant Personal Data, however such subprocessors are only permitted to process data, for the purposes of providing their specifically contracted services to Roadie. 

10.3	Roadie will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such subprocessors utilize reasonable industry recognized security measures to protect against loss, misuse and unauthorized viewing of the information Customer provides to Roadie. 

Third Party Providers Appointed by Customer:

10.4	Customer may elect to subscribe to third party services that may integrate with the Product or Professional Services (Third Party Solutions as defined in the Agreement)

10.5	Where Customer chooses to integrate with a Third Party Solution, this may entail providing Roadie with access to Personal Data held by such Third Party Solution, and may require the providers of such Third Party Solution to have access to Personal Data. Customer must notify Roadie and put in place a written contract between Customer and Roadie as required under Article 28 GDPR relating to any extra categories of Personal Data that Roadie will process on behalf of Customer due to such integration. Customer shall not send any personal data to Roadie unnecessarily.

10.6	With regard to Third Party Solutions, Customer acknowledges and agrees that: 

10.6.1	Roadie has no contractual relationship with such third parties (or if it does, it is relating to Roadie’s relationship to that party and not Customer’s nor Customer Data), and no responsibility for Personal Data once such a transfer commences, nor for the duration such third party holds the relevant data. Roadie does not audit the adequacy or otherwise confirm the security or organizational measures employed by such third parties, which is Customer’s sole responsibility. 

10.6.2	Customer is responsible for ensuring that Customer’s and Roadie’s use of the Product and Professional Services and integration with a Third Party Solution complies with any service terms of the applicable Third Party Solution. Roadie is not required to maintain Personal Data collected in breach of any relevant data protection or other applicable laws. 

10.6.3	Customer is responsible for obtaining consent from its personnel for the use and deployment of all Third Party Solutions or Customer Data subject to the E-Privacy Directive that will process data regulated by the E-Privacy Directive on the Product. 

10.7	Roadie makes no representations as to the appropriateness or legality of Customer’s choice to permit such third parties to have access to its Personal Data, and Customer is responsible for ensuring that it has all requisite consents and has provided any required notices to data subjects with respect to this processing of their data. Roadie is not responsible for the processing of Personal Data by Third Party Solutions. 

10.8	SUPPLIER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES OR FOR LOSS, DAMAGES, OR CLAIMS ARISING AS A RESULT OF DEPLOYING INTEGRATION CODE FACILITATING TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OR MAKING A TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA ON CUSTOMER’S BEHALF. SUPPLIER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH THIRD PARTY FOR RECEIPT OF PERSONAL DATA NOR OF THE SUITABILITY OF THE THIRD PARTY SOLUTIONS TO PROCESS PERSONAL DATA. 

### 11. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA BY SUBPROCESSORS OF SUPPLIER

11.1	Roadie may only authorise a subprocessor to process Personal Data provided that Roadie has entered into a written agreement with such subprocessor on terms which are substantially the same as those set out in this DPA. Where a subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, Roadie shall remain liable to Customer for the performance of the data protection obligations of the relevant subprocessor.

11.2	Customer provide a general authorisation to Roadie to engage the subprocessors as are appointed on the date this DPA comes into force.

11.3	Roadie will with thirty (30) days’ notice inform Customer of any additional subprocessors that will process Personal Data under this Agreement and Customer shall be entitled to make any objections thereto. If no objections have been received within ten (10) days, the proposed subprocessor shall be deemed accepted. If Customer does not agree to the subprocessor, the parties shall attempt to settle the disagreement and if the parties cannot agree on the use of a subprocessor, Roadie may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice, such termination to take effect on the earlier of (i) the date on which Roadie will commence using the services of the relevant subprocessor in relation to the Product and/or Professional Services provided to Customer or (ii) one (1) month after the date of Customer’s written notice. 

11.4 As listed in the Subprocessor Details, some Roadie subprocessors process Personal Data outside the EEA. Customer consents to this processing by Roadie, provided the following provisions are in place: 

11.4.1 the subprocessor is processing the Personal Data in a territory which is subject to adequacy decision that the territory provides adequate protection for the privacy rights of individuals; or

11.4.2 the subprocessor participates in a valid cross-border transfer mechanism under the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses or Data Privacy Framework so that Roadie (and, where appropriate, the Customer) can ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of protection with respect to the privacy rights of individuals as required. 

11.5 Other than with respect to the transfer of Personal Data to subprocessors listed in the Subprocessor Details, Roadie will only transfer Personal Data outside the EEA or UK on Customer’s specific request. Examples of why Customer may make such a request are transfers of such data to Customer or Customer’s affiliates, where Customer or Customer’s affiliate is based outside the EEA or UK; a transfer to a third party outside of the EEA or UK for further processing of the data; a specific request by Customer that Roadie uses an third party hosting provider or where Customer opts to integrate with a Third Party Solution outside of the EEA or UK. 

11.6 Where Customer opts to send Personal Data to Third Party Solutions via integration or plug-in, Customer agrees that providers of Third Party Solutions are not subprocessors of Roadie for data protection purposes and such providers are Customer’s directly-contracted data processors acting under Customer’s instructions. 

11.7 In making a request for Roadie to transfer Personal Data, subject to EU GDPR or UK GDPR and related privacy regulations outside of the EEA or UK, Customer confirms that there is “an adequate level of protection” in place for such transfer as such term in understood under EU/UK Data Protection Law. 

11.8 Customer will indemnify and hold harmless Roadie, its subsidiaries and affiliates (and their respective employees, directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, agents and representatives) from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, penalties, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) from any claim, action, audit, investigation, regulatory action, inquiry or other proceeding that arises out of or relates to use of Personal Data by Third Party Solutions, or other transferees, or Customer’s failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations in connection with the transfer of the Personal Data outside the EEA including any applicable data protection legislation or that arises out of or relates to any subsequent use of the Personal Data by the relevant transferee. This indemnification obligation set forth herein shall survive the termination of the Agreement.

12.5	Roadie agrees to enter into an alternate module of the EU SCCs or UK SCCs with Customer where reasonably required to ensure an “adequate level of protection” is in place for the transfer of such Personal Data outside the EEA. As Roadie may not be aware of jurisdictions where Customer is regulated, Customer must request this and reference the correct module of the EU SCCs or UK SCCs in the Order Form. 

12.6	Roadie has entered into EU SCCs with its subprocessors that process data outside the EEA. 

12.7	The parties agree to cooperate where, due to changes in law or practice, an alternate data transfer mechanism is required to be put into operation to ensure an “adequate level of protection” is in place for transfer of data outside the EEA under EU/UK Data Protection Law.

14.1	return all Personal Data to Customer; or

14.2	delete all the Personal Data, in a manner agreed to by Customer;

at Customer’s election, unless a law binding on Roadie or its subprocessors prevents it from doing as requested or unless otherwise agreed in the Agreement (for example, where the Customer has requested Roadie continue to store Personal Data in order to ensure compliance with a legal obligation). If Customer has not made their election within 30 days of termination of the Agreement, Roadie shall delete the Personal Data.
