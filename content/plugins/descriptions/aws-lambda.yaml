          In order to perform requests to AWS lambda plugin first asks backend for temporary credentials via /api/aws/credentials.
          (it uses @roadiehq/backstage-plugin-aws-auth backend plugin)
          Regardless of what auth method you use - you can also decide what functions to show in the table
          (what functions particular service uses) by annotating backstage.yaml with name of the functions separated by comma, like'
    language: yaml

      metadata:
        annotations:
          aws.com/lambda/function-name: HelloWorld
          aws.com/lambda/region: us-east-1

# Optional. Use this to suit the brand of the tool that the plugin integrates with.
