    code: | 
      // packages/app/src/api.ts
      import { createApiFactory } from '@backstage/core';
      import { costInsightsApiRef } from '@backstage/plugin-cost-insights';
      import { CostInsightsClient } from './path/to/file';

      export const apis = [
        createApiFactory({
          api: costInsightsApiRef,
          deps: {},
          factory: () => new CostInsightsClient(),
        }),
      ];
