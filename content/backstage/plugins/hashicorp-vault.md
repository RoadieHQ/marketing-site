## Including secrets in the Catalog

The Hashicorp Vault plugin for Backstage allows you to include secrets as part of your Catalog's components. You'll have to add the Vault's path to your secrets relevant to each component in their respective `catalog-info.yaml`.

For instance, for my `ReallyCool` component, which stores secrets in Vault's `secrets/path/to/really-cool`, then I need to set an annotation like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  # ...
  annotations:
    vault.io/secrets-path: path/to/really-cool
```

As you can see, the path you specify here is be relative to what you set as `secretEngine` in `app-config.yaml`.

## Token requirements

This Backstage plugin needs a Vault token to be able to access a list of secrets URLs. The plugin only needs `LIST` capabilities.

The plugin also comes with an auto-renewal option, to enable it, include self-renewal capabilities in your token's custom policy:

```
# Allows token to renew itself
path "auth/token/renew-self" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```
