Jira offers numerous features like sprints for Scrum management and other agile boards like Kanban. This allows teams to organize projects, define, assign and prioritize tasks.

        '/jira/api':
          target: '<JIRA_URL>'

  - intro: Set img-src in Content Security Policy
    language: yaml

      // app-config.yaml
      backend:
        # ...
        csp:
          img-src: 
            # "'self'" and 'data' are from the backstage default but must be set since img-src is overriden
            - "'self'"
            - 'data:'
            # Allow your Jira instance for @roadiehq/backstage-plugin-jira

      const overviewContent = (
        <Grid container spacing={3} alignItems="stretch">
          <EntitySwitch>
            <EntitySwitch.Case if={isJiraAvailable}>
              <Grid item md={6}>
                <EntityJiraOverviewCard />
              </Grid>
            </EntitySwitch.Case>
          </EntitySwitch>
        </Grid>

  - intro: Add annotation to the yaml config file of a component
    language: yaml
    sectionId: 'add-annotations'
    code: |
      metadata:
        annotations:
          jira/project-key: <example-jira-project-key>
          jira/component: <example-component> # optional, you might skip this value to fetch data for all components
          jira/token-type: Bearer # optional, used for Activity stream feed. If you are using Basic auth you can skip this.

  - intro: Even though you can use Bearer token please keep in mind that Activity stream feed will only contain entries that are visible to anonymous users. In order to view restricted content you will need to authenticate via Basic authentication, as described in official documentation (https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/consuming-an-activity-streams-feed/#authentication).

  - intro: Provide the JIRA_TOKEN environmental variable (instructions at the notes below)
---


1. Obtain you [personal token from Jira](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
2. Create a base64-encoded string by converting a string in format

   ```
   <your-atlassian-account-mail>:<your-jira-token>
   ```

   for example:

   ```
   jira-mail@example.com:hTBgqVcrcxRYpT5TCzTA9C0F
   ```

   converts to base64

   ```
   amlyYS1tYWlsQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tOmhUQmdxVmNyY3hSWXBUNVRDelRBOUMwRg==
   ```

3. Save it as the environmental variable `JIRA_TOKEN` with `Basic` prefix, for example:

   ```
   JIRA_TOKEN='Basic amlyYS1tYWlsQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tOmhUQmdxVmNyY3hSWXBUNVRDelRBOUMwRg=='
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are running backstage locally, you can provide the variable by the command

   ```
   env JIRA_TOKEN='Basic amlyYS1tYWlsQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tOmhUQmdxVmNyY3hSWXBUNVRDelRBOUMwRg==' yarn dev
   ```
