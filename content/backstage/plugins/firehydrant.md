FireHydrant.io is an incident management tool with a variety of reliability management features including its own service catalog. Backstage components can be added to the FireHydrant service catalog.

![Create service on FireHydrant.io](../../assets/backstage/plugins/firehydrant/firehydrant-create-service.png)

Typically, Backstage components are linked to external services like FireHydrant.io by adding annotations to the component's `catalog-info.yaml`. The FireHydrant plugin does not require an annotation. Instead, the Backstage component is added to the FireHydrant.io service catalog following a very specific naming convention: `component-type:namespace/component-name`.

For example, a component of type `Component`, in the `default` namespace, named `backstage-sample-service` would need to be added to the FireHydrant.io service catalog as `Component:default/backstage-sample-service`. Here is what that component would loook like in the Backstage catalog:

And here is what the Matching component would look like in the FireHydrant.io service catalog:

## Obtaining a FireHydrant Authorization Token

Backstage needs an authorization token to authenticate to the FireHydrant.io API. This token is obtained by created a new bot configuration on FireHydrant.io:

![Create bot on FireHydrant.io, step 1](../../assets/backstage/plugins/firehydrant/firehydrant-create-bot.png)

Add the authorization token directly to `app-config.yaml` or refer to it from an environment variable.
