## Introduction

Roadie exposes a number of [Model Context Protocol Servers (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) via our authenticated API that can provide AI tools like agents and LLMs with structured data to answer complex questions about your catalog and powerful workflow capabilities using the scaffolder.

## Available MCP Servers

Roadie currently provides six MCP servers that enable AI assistants to interact with your Backstage catalog:

- **[API Docs Query Server](api-docs-query)** - Discover and retrieve API documentation and specifications
  - https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/api-docs-query
- **[Backend Config Server](backend-config)** - Manage and query backend configuration including proxy settings and secrets
  - https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/backend-config
- **[Catalog Decorators Server](catalog-decorators)** - Manage catalog entity decorators and fragments
  - https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/catalog-decorators
- **[Rich Catalog Entity Server](rich-catalog-entity)** - Access catalog entity data, relationships, and documentation
  - https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/rich-catalog-entity
- **[Scaffolder Server](scaffolder)** - Find, validate, and execute Backstage scaffolder templates  
  - https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/scaffolder-use
- **[Tech Insights Facts Server](tech-insights-facts)** - Access operational metrics, security data, and compliance information

## Prerequisites

- Roadie tenant with populated catalog
- Active Roadie API token
- AI assistant or MCP client configured to use Roadie's MCP servers

## Tool Integration Setup

### Setting up MCP Servers in Popular AI Tools

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code with Copilot</strong></summary>

VS Code supports [MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers). 

Here's how to configure Roadie's for use with Copilot:

#### Configure MCP Servers

Add the following configuration to your settings (`~/.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "roadie-api-docs": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/api-docs-query",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-backend-config": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/backend-config",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-catalog-decorators": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/catalog-decorators",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-scaffolder": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/scaffolder-use",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-catalog": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/rich-catalog-entity",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-insights": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/tech-insights-facts",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get Your API Token

1. Log into your Roadie instance
2. Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
4. Replace `<roadie_api_token>` with your actual token

#### Check your Settings

- In settings, ensure `chat.mcp.enabled` is set to `enabled`. 
- Occassionally your organisation will manage these settings (you will see something like "managed by organization" next to a given setting). If this is the case and `chat.mcp.enabled` is not set to enabled you will need to talk to whomever manages those settings.

#### Test the Integration

Open VS Code and try asking Copilot questions like:
- "What APIs are available for user management?"
- "Who owns the payment-service component?"
- "Create a fragment to add team ownership to the auth-service"

#### Skipping steps

- VSCode omits some information-only steps and/or auto-completes various actions our MCP tools request. That is due to a permissive interpretation of the protocols `readOnlyHint: true` flag, which is best practice to use on MCP servers [based on the protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/schema#toolannotations). The flag represents non-destructive tools which only return information and do not alter the MCP clients environment. VSCode interprets `readOnlyHints` as default permissable to execute, whereas most other MCP clients require user consent or a flag to be set in config before they autocomplete.

      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/api-docs-query",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-backend-config": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/backend-config",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-catalog-decorators": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/catalog-decorators",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-scaffolder": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/scaffolder-use",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <roadie_api_token>"
      }
    },
    "roadie-catalog": {
      "url": "https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/rich-catalog-entity",
      "headers": {

- "Add monitoring annotations to the user-service component"

</details>

### Authentication Setup

You will need an API token for your user to connect with these MCP servers. See [API Token docs here](/docs/api/authorization/). You may need an admin user to provide you with a Roadie API Token.

### Troubleshooting Setup

**Common Issues:**

1. **Authentication Errors**: 
   - Verify your API token is correct and not expired
   - Check that the token has appropriate permissions

2. **Connection Failures**:
   - Verify network connectivity to your Roadie instance
   - Check that the MCP API endpoints are accessible

3. **Permission Denied**:
   - Review your API token permissions
   - Contact your Roadie administrator for access

4. **MCP Server Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify the URL format is correct: `https://api.roadie.so/api/mcp/v1/<server-name>`
   - Check that all required headers are included in the configuration
   - Ensure environment variables are properly set

5. **Global IDE Settings can Block MCP Server Access**:
   - Verify that access to remote authenticated MCP servers is enabled. For example, in VSCode the setting `chat.mcp.enabled` should be set to `enabled`.
   - Occassionally your organisation will manage these settings and if they are not enabled you will need to talk to your support team or whomever manages those settings. For example, in VSCode you will see something like "managed by organization".


## Best Practices

### API Discovery

- Start with broad search terms and refine based on results

### Template Execution

- Always validate inputs before execution to catch errors early
- Provide clear, descriptive names for generated projects

### Error Handling

- Check validation results before proceeding with template execution
- Monitor task status for long-running templates
- Review error messages for troubleshooting guidance
- Ensure proper permissions are in place before execution

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Verify your Roadie API credentials are configured correctly
- Ensure your MCP client is properly authenticated

**Permission Denied**
