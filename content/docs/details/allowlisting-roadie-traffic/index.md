description: In order to access Roadie, your IT department may need to allowlist certain IPs and hostnames.
---

## Introduction

Some IT departments block incoming or outgoing TCP traffic. This may prevent Roadie working correctly.
To allow all traffic to and from Roadie, please ask your IT departments to allowlist the following IP addresses and hostnames.

## IP Addresses

In order for Roadie to access your infrastructure, perhaps for custom plugin support, you may need to allowlist our IPs.

All Roadie traffic comes from the following IPs:

```
54.228.140.202
18.203.19.58
34.248.243.70
```

## Hostnames

If your IT department requires an allow list of domains, please use the following:

```
<yourtenant>.roadie.so
<yourtenant>.vouch.roadie.so
*.roadie.systems

```
