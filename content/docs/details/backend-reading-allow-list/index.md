## Introduction

The Backstage backend restricts what resources can be fetched by default. 
This guide describes how to configure this list. This would allow you to do something like 
fetch a public API definition in a catalog info file.

By default only *.example.com and *.mozilla.org are allowed.

## Configuration

Navigate to `administration/backend` in Roadie you should be able to click "add item" then enter the hostname of
the resource you want to access in the host field and click "Save" then "Apply & restart".

If you want to restrict access further you can add a list of paths and only resources under those paths will be allowed.
