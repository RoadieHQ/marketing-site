## Introduction

This page explains the permissions required by the various GitHub Apps we use at Roadie.

Roadie provides two GitHub apps. If you do not wish to use the scaffolder, you can choose the Lite GitHub app in order to reduce the permissions granted.

## Roadie Backstage Lite

This app enables the core Backstage functionality of the service catalog and TechDocs.

These are the repository permissions required:

| Name              | Access level | Reason required                                                                                                                                                                              |
