## Introduction

The Allure plugin can display the Allure reports of the component in your Roadie Backstage catalog.

This page explains how to configure it in Roadie Backstage.

## Prerequisites

1. You must be an admin in Roadie. By default, all users are admins. Learn how to designate certain users as admins [here](/docs/getting-started/create-admin-group/).
2. Your Allure reports must be accessible by Roadie backend instances. To allow list Roadie access you can check our IPs [here](/docs/details/allowlisting-roadie-traffic/).


## Step 1: Save your hosted Allure report URL into Roadie

Navigate to `Administration > Settings > Allure` and set up the URL where your Allure reports are hosted. Note that this URL needs to be accessible from Roadie backend.

## Step 2: Modify your catalog-info.yaml files to contain a reference to the Allure project 

```yaml
# catalog-info.yaml
...
metadata:
  annotations: 
    qameta.io/allure-project: projectname
...
```

## Step 3: Add Allure Report UI component to your Roadie instance

The plugin provides an UI component with a name `EntityAllureReportContent` which can be added as a tab into your Roadie instance. Learn how to do that in [here](/docs/details/updating-the-ui/). 

## Useful information

The Allure plugin constructs the displayable path based on the *base URL* defined in Roadie config section and *project id* defined in the catalog manifest file. The final URL requested by the plugin looks like this: 
```text
<Base URL>/projects/<Project Id>/reports/latest/index.html
```
