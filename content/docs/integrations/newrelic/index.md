## Introduction

In order to make requests to the NewRelic API, you must provide Roadie with an API key. Roadie provides two different New Relic plugins within the installation, providing both page and individual entity page functionality. 

## Steps

### Configure New Relic secret and dashboard plugin

1. Go to https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher and follow the steps to create a user-api-key for NewRelic.

2. Give the token a name and click "Create a key".

3. Click the icon alongside the key you have created and click "Copy key"

4. Login to Roadie and visit the administration -> settings -> secrets (https://\<tenant name\>.roadie.so/administration/settings/secrets) page.

5. Click the pencil icon alongside the `NEW_RELIC_REST_API_KEY` and paste the API key you copied earlier.

6. Navigate to administration -> New Relic Dashboard and select the data region of your New Relic account. Click 'Save' and 'Apply'

7. It can take up to 2 minutes for the API key and configuration to be applied.
