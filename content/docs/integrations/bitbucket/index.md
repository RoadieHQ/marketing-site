## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the steps required to connect Roadie to your Bitbucket repositories.

## Step 1: Save Bitbucket integration config in Roadie

By adding a Bitbucket integration you will allow Roadie to access the YAML metadata files that Backstage needs to operate.

Roadie supports Bitbucket configuration on both Bitbucket Cloud and self-hosted Bitbucket server. The authentication methods supported are either with Token or a Username + Application Password authentication. Username + Application Password is the preferred authentication method since it provides more granular options to control the access to give to the integration. If you are connecting to a Bitbucket server, Username + Application Password is the only supported connection method. 

1. Click the Administration link in the bottom left of the application.
