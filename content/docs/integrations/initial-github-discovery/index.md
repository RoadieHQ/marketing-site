## Introduction

Roadie can perform on demand syncs with your organisation. This is useful in a case where you already have `catalog-info.yaml` files distributed in your organization and you'd like Roadie to pick them up.


## Prerequisites

- You must have installed the Roadie GitHub app in your organisation as described [here](/docs/getting-started/install-github-app/)
- You must be an Admin of Roadie Backstage, as [described here](/docs/getting-started/create-admin-group/).

## Steps

1. Visit the Administration > Settings page and click on GitHub under Integrations
2. Scroll down to the `Import Existing Components` section.

3. Press the `IMPORT` button in the bottom left corner.
4. A modal will open up.

5. Type the target url that you used in your `app-config.yaml` files under the `catalog.locations` key with the type: github-discovery.
6. Press the `IMPORT` button in the bottom right corner
7. You can see a table with all of the discovered repos that got added to the roadie catalog.

You can go to the catalog and see your added components.
