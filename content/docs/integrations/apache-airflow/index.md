## Introduction

The Backstage Apache Airflow plugin serves as frontend to the REST API exposed by Apache Airflow to show Apache Airflow's information inside Backstage.

## Using the Plugin

1. Add a proxy configuration in Roadie at `/administration/settings/proxy` - see guide [here](/docs/custom-plugins/connectivity/proxy/#setup).

Path: `/airflow`
Target: `https://your.airflow.instance.com/api/v1`
Headers: `Authorization`: `Basic ${APACHE_AIRFLOW_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN}`

2. Get and provide a APACHE_AIRFLOW_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN as an environment variable in Roadie at `/administration/apache-airflow` - see below for instructions on how to get the token.

3. Set the `baseUrl` for your Apache Airflow webserver in the Apache Airflow plugin options at `/administration/apache-airflow`

## Basic Authentication token

In order to make requests to your Apache Airflow API, you must provide Roadie with a basic authentication token.

1. The basic authorization token is the base64 encoding of the username and password of your instance.

    example:
        `echo -n "airflow:airflow" | base64 -w0`
