## Introduction

The Open API spec support of Roadie Backstage allows users to look up and read the OpenAPI specs of

Creating Open API specs is outside the scope of this documentation. Please see the [Swagger
OpenAPI Getting Started Guide](https://swagger.io/tools/open-source/getting-started/) for more
