description: How to give Roadie the access it needs to your GitHub org.
---

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the steps required to connect Roadie to your GitHub org. If you are configuring GitHub enterprise, please follow the steps [here](/docs/details/github-enterprise/).

## Prerequisites

If your IT department filters your outbound access by hostname, you may need to allow access to Roadie hostnames before proceeding. More information on this can be found [here](/docs/details/allowlisting-roadie-traffic/).

## Step 1: Install the Roadie GitHub app

Installing the GitHub App will allow Roadie to access the YAML metadata files that Backstage needs to operate. Learn more about the [permissions required](/docs/integrations/github-app-permissions/).

1. Click the Administration link in the bottom left of the application.

5. Choose your GitHub organization and follow the steps to install the app.

ℹ️ &nbsp;If you are not an owner of your GitHub organization, you will need to ask an owner to approve the App installation and then contact us to enable the App.

Roadie will automatically ingest files called: `catalog-info.yaml` that have been added to your repositories after the Roadie GitHub app is installed. To have more granular control (e.g. you don't want to call them catalog-info.yaml) over what files Roadie should ingest, go to the [GitHub discovery docs](/docs/integrations/github-discovery/).

If you used Backstage before and you already have `catalog-info.yaml` files in your repos please go to the [initial discovery](/docs/integrations/initial-github-discovery) docs.

## Next steps

Now that a connection to GitHub is established, you can [make yourself an admin on Roadie](/docs/getting-started/create-admin-group/).
