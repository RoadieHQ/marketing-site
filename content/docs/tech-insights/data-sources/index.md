Data Sources periodically collect Facts about your services from third-party vendors or arbitrary APIs. The Facts collected by Data Sources are used for defining Checks. Roadie comes with a handful of built-in Data Sources with predefined Facts that you can use without any setup. You can also define your own Data Sources, which can use external APIs or files in a repository as a source of truth.

To manage Data Sources, go to Tech Insights â†’ Data Sources.
