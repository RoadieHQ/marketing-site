### What are they?
Data Sources periodically collect Facts about your services from third-party vendors or arbitrary APIs. 

The Facts collected by Data Sources can be used for defining Checks. You can view the Facts collected by a Data Source by clicking on the Data Source and finding the facts on the details page.  

### Ready made and Custom Data Sources
[Built-in Data Sources](('../builtin-data-sources/')) with predefined Facts are available to use without any setup. 

However, you can also [define your own custom Data Sources]('../define-custom-data-sources/'), which can pull data from external APIs or the files in a repository.

To manage Data Sources, go to Tech Insights â†’ Data Sources.
