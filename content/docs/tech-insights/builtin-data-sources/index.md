 Roadie includes several (built-in) Data Sources for common vendors such as Datadog, Snyk, PagerDuty, and GitHub. All built-in Data Sources have pre-defined Facts you can use for defining your [Checks](../checks/).

### Configuring Built-in Data Sources

Built-in Data Sources use integration configurations from common Backstage plugins and annotations provided by them. You can see configuration instructions for integrations on their respective documentation pages in [the Plugins & Integrations page](/docs/integrations/).

You will find a list of built-in Data Sources, below, with annotations used by them and facts they currently include.

### Datadog Data Source

**Annotations used:** 
 * `datadoghq.com/slo_tag`, for retrieving SLOs 
 * `datadoghq.com/monitor_tags`, for retrieving monitors
