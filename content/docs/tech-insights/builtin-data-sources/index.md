title: Using Built-in Data Sources

description: Built-in Data Sources.
---

Roadie includes several (built-in) Data Sources for common vendors such as Datadog, Snyk, PagerDuty, and GitHub.

All built-in Data Sources have pre-defined Facts you can use for defining your [Checks](../checks/). You can view the
Facts on the detail page for the individual Data Source or when adding a Check.

You can also [create your own custom Data Sources]('../define-custom-data-sources/') if the built-in ones do not provide
the Facts you need.

### Configuring Built-in Data Sources

Built-in Data Sources use integration configurations from common Backstage plugins and annotations provided by them. You
can see configuration instructions for integrations on their respective documentation pages
in [the Plugins & Integrations page](/docs/integrations/).

We have built several Data Sources, which you can find explained below, together with annotations used by them and facts
they currently include. You can get a list of the facts available on each data source within the app as well. You can
learn how to access this information within the app on
the [Data Source results and details page](../data-source-details/).

This list will probably have better accuracy, since we update facts frequently.

As mentioned above, if you don't find what you are looking for and/or want to create something we haven't provided out of the
box, Roadie Tech Insights lets you [define custom Data Sources](../define-custom-data-sources/).

### Datadog Data Source

Imports data from Datadog which can be used to create Tech Insights checks.

**Annotations used:**

* `datadoghq.com/slo_tag` for retrieving SLOs
* `datadoghq.com/monitor_tags` for retrieving monitors

#### Authentication

Authentication is done via

* `DD_API_TOKEN` [Read more](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/)
* `DD_APP_TOKEN` [Read more](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/)

### Dependabot Alerts Data Source

Generates fact data from GitHub Dependabot Alerts for the entity.

**Annotations used:** `github.com/project-slug`

#### Authentication

Authentication is done via [GitHub App](../../details/github-app-permissions/) or
`GITHUB TOKEN` [Read more](../../integrations/github-token/).

If you have GitHub App installed, access will be granted based on permissions granted for it. In case you haven't
installed the GitHub app, we will check for `GITHUB TOKEN` which is used to authenticate with the GitHub APIs.

### Snyk Data Source

Generates fact data about Snyk projects configured for the entity.

**Annotations used:**

* `snyk.io/org-name`, if omitted, globally configured Snyk org is used
* `snyk.io/target-id`, specify a single target by name or ID
* `snyk.io/targets`, specify one or more targets, by name or ID
* `snyk.io/project-ids`, are the project ID (see slug in url or ID in project settings) If multiple projects (like
  multiple package.json or pom files, add them with increasing number), add them comma separated
* `github.com/project-slug`, to identify the target based on its GitHub repository name
* `snyk.io/exclude-project-ids`, to exclude specific projects you might not want.

The data source follows the same annotation structure as the
official [Snyk Backstage plugin](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/backstage-plugin-snyk#getting-started). It is
possible to use multiple different annotations. At a minimum one of `targets`, `target-id`, `project-ids` or GitHub
project slug is needed. Read more about these
concepts [here](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/introduction-to-snyk-projects).
