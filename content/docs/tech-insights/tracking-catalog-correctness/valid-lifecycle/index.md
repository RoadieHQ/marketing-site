The `spec.lifecycle` of a component can be a useful indicator of the maturity of a component. However, it is an arbitrary string in the Backstage spec, and the catalog can get confusing when people enter arbitrary values.

You can enforce a small number of valid values with the following check:

| Field | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Backstage component metadata lifecycle should be valid |
| Description | Only a small number of lifecycles are supported. |
| Data source | Entity Metadata (this is built-in). |
| Fact | Lifecycle |
| Fact operator | Is One Of |
| Value | production,deprecated,experimental |

Make sure to adapt the Value field according to the lifecycles you want to support.
