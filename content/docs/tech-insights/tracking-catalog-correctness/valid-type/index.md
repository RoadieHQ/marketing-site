In Backstage, the `spec.type` is important to the build up your [system model](https://roadie.io/blog/modelling-software-backstage/) in the Catalog. However, `spec.type` can accept arbitrary strings. You can use Tech Insights to ensure all your components are following your desired schema.

Create a check with the following attributes:

| Field | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Backstage Component type must be valid. |
| Description | Only a small number of Component types are valid. service, website, library |
| Data source | Entity Metadata (this is built-in). |
| Fact | Type |
| Fact operator | Is One Of |
| Value | library,website,service,documentation |

Make sure to adapt the Value field according to the types you want to support.
