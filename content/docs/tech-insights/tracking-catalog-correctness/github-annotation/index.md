The GitHub annotation powers more functionalities in Backstage than any other. Frequently, the GitHub project slug is used to load data related to the associated entity.

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: marketing-site
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: RoadieHQ/marketing-site
```

Backstage works best when the GitHub project-slug annotation is set on as many components as possible.

To create a check to ensure that the annotation is set, use the following attributes:

| Field | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Name | GitHub annotation must be set on Backstage Component metadata |
| Description | Setting the component metadata will allow many Backstage GitHub plugins and features to work |
| Data source | Entity Metadata (built-in). |
| Fact | Annotation keys (this returns a list of all of the annotation keys on an entity) |
| Fact operator | Contains |
| Value | github.com/project-slug |

Once this check completes its first run, you should see data come in showing the Backstage entities which need improvement.
