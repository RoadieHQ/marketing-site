In order to show a Scorecard in the Catalog Entity page, as shown below, you’ll have to define it from the Tech Insights → Scorecards page.

![Scorecard Catalog](./scorecard-catalog.png)

Once you’re in Tech Insights → Scorecards, find a Scorecard you wish to add. From kebab menu select ‘Add to Catalog’

![Add Scorecard to catalog](./add-to-catalog-scorecard.png)

Then select option which best applies to your use case.

![Add Scorecard](./add-scorecard-to-catalog.png)

Scorecard should now be visible under the layout page you have selected.


### Adding a Scorecard to the Catalog - the hard way

You can also add a Scorecard in the normal way as a widget on a Component Overview page or as a tab. 

You will need to add a prop to the widget to tell it which Scorecard to show for the component using the `scorecardId` field like so:

```json
{
  "scorecardId": "0e9cf72e-a279-4aa7-8296-9a0f5752ca9c"
}
```
You can find the id for the Scorecard in the url when viewing the Scorecard you want to display i.e. `/tech-insights/scorecards/1beea874-fa64-4bc1-b04d-977f8c6a071b`.
