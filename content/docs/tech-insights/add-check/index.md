### Fix Link

![Fix Link section](./create-check-fix-link.png)

### Applies to

You can define filters to target which entities should this check run against
In the Applies to section you can select which entites will be included in this check and which entities will be excluded.

![Applies To section](./create-check-entity-filter.png)

The above configuration means the Check will run against components with type library that does not have the tag infrastructure

Providing multiple selection in a single input results in an `OR` relation between the selections.
Selecting from multiple input fields(Type, Tags, Kind) end up with a relation `AND` between the fields.

For example:
Selecting `type: service, tags: infrastructure` will exclude every entity Which has type service `AND` contains an infrastructure tag. However it won't exclude services which does not contain the tag, or components that contain only the tag but they are not services.

### Save

If you are still uncertain if you want to publish the check, you can save it as a draft an publish it later.

![Check draft](./create-check-draft.png)

Publishing a check based on [Draft Data Source](../data-sources/) will publish that Data Source as well and vice versa.

After you have added the check, make sure to refresh check results so it is taken into calculation from that moment on.
