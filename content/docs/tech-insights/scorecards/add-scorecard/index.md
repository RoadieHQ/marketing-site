4 - Owner which can be either a user or a group.

Once you are happy with the created scorecard, save it and you should be able to see it in overview screen.

Same as for the [Data Source](../data-sources/) [Checks](../checks/), you can save a scorecard as a draft until you are completely happy with it and certaing you want to publish it. 

** Note that publishing a draft scorecard will publish all draft Checks and Data Source it is based on.**
