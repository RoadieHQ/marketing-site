description: How to model your organisation in the Catalog
---

Your organisation can be modeled in Roadie's Catalog using a variety of different top level `Kinds` which are intended to be broad buckets, combined with a `spec.type` field that can be used to more precisely describe the category. 

For instance the `Component` Kind could have a type of `website` or `internal-tooling` or `external-library` to describe a wide variety of software types and contexts. 

Similarly, it is common for organisations to have multiple logical groupings at higher levels like `System` and `Domain` such as "Bounded Context" or "Value Stream". These can also be modeled using `spec.type` and then displayed in their own tab on the Catalog page using our custom Catalog Tab editor. 

The `spec.type` field is not constrained - you can add anything you like, but it is best practice to:
- Establish a convention such as lowercase and kebab case for new types
- Not use types that should be in a different Kind - i.e. infrastructure as code should be a series of `Resource` kinds rather than `Component` kinds with a type of `iac`.
- Agree a limited set of types for each Kind and encourage care/consensus in adding new ones (having too many, overly specific types can make them less useful sometimes as it can become harder to find things)
- Clean up duplicates with different formating regularly by checking available select options for the type filter on Catalog pages
